# Quest

*A scenario language called [Quest](https://github.com/compound-finance/quest)*

This is the pure Deno implementation of Quest.
The original implementation was a [pure Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@jflatow/quest).
It is a design goal to be able to continue to `import('quest.bundle.js')` from anywhere (especially an Observable notebook) off any branch of this repository,
 hence the compiled bundle is also kept together in this source tree.

## Overview

...

## Compiling

```
make
```

## Testing

XXX: currently `fetch` seems to be broken in Deno
 if this doesn't get fixed...
